# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis  
The project is about analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.
So for this project we worked doing ETL again. This time we worked with AmazonÂ´s AWS. We created a RDS Database, connected to PgAdmin and we pulled the information from a bucket that amazon gives out. Using Pyspark we completed this ETL process:  


## Results

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
- **Vine reviews**: 94 
- **Non-Vine reviews**: 40471  
  
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?  
- **5 start Vine reviews**: 48 
- **5 star Non-Vine reviews**: 15663  
  
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?  
- **Percentage 5 star Vine reviews**: 51.06% 
- **Percentage 5 star Non-Vine reviews**: 38.71%  

## Summary:  
It would be considered a positive bias since 51% of the reviews in the Vine program were 5 stars reviews and the percentage in the non-Vine reviews is only 39%
